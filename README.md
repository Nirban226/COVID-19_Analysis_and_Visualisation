# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on analysing and visualising COVID-19 data using Plotly Express in Python. It involves creating various bar charts, line graphs, bubble charts, and scatter plots. The visualization quality is top-notch, making complex data easier to understand. The analysis provides insights into COVID-19 trends and impacts worldwide, helping to manage outbreaks efficiently.

## Objectives
- Summarize the COVID-19 outbreak using data science and visual analytics.
- Examine the impact of best practices and preventive measures in different sectors.
- Enable outbreak management with available health resources.

## Tools and Technologies Used

## Stepwise Implementation
### Step 1: Importing Necessary Libraries
Ensure all required libraries are installed and imported for analysis and visualization.

### Step 2: Importing the Datasets
Datasets are imported using Pandas `read_csv()` for analysis.

### Step 3: Data Cleaning
Preprocessing and handling missing data to ensure accuracy in visualization.

### Step 4: Bar Graphs - Country Comparisons
Comparison of countries based on total cases, deaths, recoveries, and total tests.

### Step 5: Bubble Charts - Continent-wise Analysis
Scatter plots to visualize total cases per continent.

### Step 6: Bubble Charts - Country-wise Analysis
Analyzing country-wise COVID-19 data for the top 50 countries.

### Step 7: Advanced Data Visualization
Detailed bar graphs for the most affected countries.

### Step 8: Country-Specific Analysis (USA Example)
Focused analysis of COVID-19 data in the United States.

### Step 9: Choropleth Maps for COVID-19 Growth
Mapping the spread of COVID-19 globally from January to July 2020.

### Step 10: Word Cloud for COVID-19 Death Causes
Visual representation of leading causes of COVID-19 deaths.
